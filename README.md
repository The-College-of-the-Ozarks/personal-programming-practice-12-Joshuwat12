# Programming 1: Personal Programming Practice 12

---

Write a program to solve the following problems. You may discuss and collaborate with your peers, but you should submit your own code and fully understand all code you submit. If you work with others on one of the parts, cite your collaborators in a comment near the top of that file.

In **shapes.py**, classes for Point and Triangle have been defined, along with a few functions which use Points and/or Triangles. Your task is to transform this code into a more readable and more object-oriented organizational structure and illustrate its effectiveness. Your final product should have only methods, no standalone functions, in the following files:
- **point.py,** with the definition of the Point class including slope and distance methods.
- **triangle.py,** with the definition of the Triangle class including sides_list, perimeter, area, is_right, is_degen, and is_congruent methods.
- **main.py,** with no function or class definitions. This file should contain code that runs all of the defined methods *with no user input*, printing descriptions of what was run (parameters and return values). Run each method in such a way that every reasonable output is obtained at some point.
